In traditional replacement function, we can only replace all targets to a new specified text.In StringEx, you can replace targets with a column.Look source below:

```
example1 Jimmy Punch
example2 Jimmy Kick
example3 Jimmy Jump
example4 Jimmy Fly
```

We want to replace all the targets ```Jimmy``` to get the result as this:

```
example1 Cloz Punch
example2 Billy Kick
example3 Jack Jump
example4 Bolt Fly
```

In one picture to descript the process of **Replace**, that must be:
