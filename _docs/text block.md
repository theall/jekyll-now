### What is text block?

Text block is a kind of plain text that every line has the similar structure.Sometimes it looks like a table without border.

```python
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 
9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48
49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56
57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64
```

Sometimes it has no consistent structure, but it still can be took as a text block.

```yaml
- title: "Kyrie"
duration: "4:25"
- title: "Gloria"
duration: "9:53"
- title: "Credo"
duration: "9:09"
- title: "Sanctus & Benedictus"
duration: "7:47"
- title: "Agnus Dei I, II & III"
duration: "6:49"
```
