## The Story

Exactly to say, this project was started at 2011 while i was emploied by company.The first version didn't publish cause i thought engaging in a bussiness is aboring.From then on, i kept improving this tool though it was only used by myself.
As time goes, i fired the companies twice, and finally in 2014 i decided to retire as the government scheduled retirement-delay program.Then i returned home to start my plan.

It's not a delightful journey, it was painful.I have to save money which make me subducte any unnecessary cost.
Everyday i eat less food, stay at home as much as possible.But i have to go out for walk cause my fitness become weaker second by second since i was graduated from the college.When i walk by the KFC house, the smell of beef leak out from the gap of door, inside of it people are busy in chewing hamburger and drinking coca cola, i will slow down and smell for a few microseconds, oh lord, it's so delicious, then my mouth wet a bit, but i have to walk away.I can't remeber the last time i have a hamburger, but i nerver forget the scene which i was chewing hamburger, this daily-scene encourage me to work hard to escape from the poor living.I could hardly believe that i would be the part of extremly poor people who spend less than one dollar everyday.But it's true, now im a poor guy, im starving.

However, i save all my energy to develop this program.I translated the first version from delphi xe2 to pyqt in the first year.But i think i made a mistake that the pyqt's license is not friendly to commercial product which means you have to buy a license from the vendor, what the worse thing is packing program developed by python is a tough trip, and the size of install er is too large to publish easily.Certainly i didn't pay the license, in the same time i almost gave up developing dektop application by any script language.That term is a darkness to me.But i didnt give up, i bought the first package of toasts in these three years, it brought me energy which cheered up me again.

So i reprogram this tool by c++ language.After a month's work, i fixed all the issues from the translation process.Then i felt so tired that i can't move even a nanometre.This feeling disappeared after i watched one episode of The Centurions on TV.It's a cartoon published by Ruby-Spears and Sunrise in 1980s.The major characters were shouting together: Power Extreme!And i felt power extreme that i thought i could defeat all the enemies without weapon systems.

After a few days's rest, i started to write help documents and build a wesite, it was a hell that i nerver did those things before.I thought i should find someone to help me, but nobody want to.So i had to do them by myself.I learned  html, css, javascript, xml, jekyll, php, nodejs, and almost all the techs related to web, then i found i got two white hairs, it's abosultely because i studied so many techs in a short time.Finally, i completed a help manual and a tiny website, though they were simple and poor, but they are my childrens.

Then i learned null-script to pack this software.I uploaded the installer to Softpedia.It's reviewed soon, the administrator wrote the description about this tool, sounds not too bad, i felt a little excited in my heart.

Oh no, i can catch a break at last.

To be continued...Ok it's the end now.
